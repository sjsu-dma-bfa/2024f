              Mixed Feelings is something that works towards showing and controlling your emotions. As well as being able to read the room so to speak. It goes through various emotional wheels using capcut and after effects as well as a little runway ai with greenscreen effects. With this piece I wanted to try something different from what I normally do and go a different route. Emotions run high throughout life and sometimes itâ€™s not something people have an easy time controlling. Bill Viola was my inspiration because of his earth, air, fire, water, piece. Something just popped into my head and I just felt like trying it out .  I got the idea from inside out on how different emotions and colors work and tried doing something along the lines of that. Working with something such as feelings is a different thing for me so it was fun being able to try to manifest this piece.
