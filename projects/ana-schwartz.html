            <p>
              Coming soon to a planet near you, IO is an alien nurse traveling across the galaxy, bringing aid and comfort to those in need. I am drawn to aliens because their unusual qualities and outsider status reflect the idea that difference should be celebrated, not diminished. IO embodies this spirit of uniqueness and serves as a mirror to my own journey as an artist. I created her during my time at San Jose State University, naming her ‘IO’ to signify ‘input/output’—a fitting tribute to the effort I’ve invested in her, now shared with others in my final gallery exhibition before graduation.
<br><br>
IO's journey reflects the challenges and aspirations I have faced as I developed my artistic voice. The three scenes in this series each convey a personal milestone: 'On to New Adventures' portrays my departure from my hometown and family to pursue art; 'Big Expectations' captures the high standards I often set for myself; and 'Sweet Victory' celebrates the achievement of my Bachelor's degree. 
<br><br>
Together, these works embody my dedication to Digital Media Art, with a focus on 3D modeling, video, and digital drawing.
<br><br>
While my artistic process is rooted in technology, I maintain a hands-on approach. Each of my models is printed, then meticulously finished, sanded, and painted by hand. This intensive process deepens my connection to the work, making each piece a labor of love. As I prepare to leave SJSU, I know this is just the beginning of my artistic journey, and I am excited to continue exploring new creative horizons.

                  Ana Schwartz is a Chamorro-American artist based in the Bay Area, known for her unique, imaginative works that blend elements of the eerie, whimsical, and cute. Operating under the artist name Comagirl, Ana crafts experience at the intersection of dreams and reality, capturing a suspended state akin to a coma. While her pieces often carry a morbid undertone, this aligns with her vision of creating a dreamlike, surreal experience that invites viewers into her world of curious and ethereal imagery.
