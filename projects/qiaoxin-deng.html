              “Kafe” is a primarily text-based game with a nostalgic pixel art style where players step into a popular maid café and interact with Aiko, an endearing maid. Players make choices from multiple options, each influencing the story's outcome and unlocking different endings. The game’s visual design is crafted in Aseprite, with programming handled in Godot, creating a cute and lighthearted aesthetic that gradually shifts, unveiling darker themes beneath the surface.
              <br>
              Initially, the café feels warm and inviting, but subtle clues suggest something is amiss. As the narrative unfolds, players encounter increasingly unsettling moments that contrast sharply with the café’s cheerful appearance. This duality between the nostalgic art and the psychological horror elements underscores a central theme: the choices we make and the unseen consequences they may hold. In Kafe, this contrast is essential, as it allows players to question their own perception, reflect on the story’s unsettling developments, and immerse themselves in the eerie experience of realizing not everything in the café is as it seems.
