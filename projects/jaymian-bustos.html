            <p>
              Death, The Inevitable, is a top down rogue-like dungeon crawler where you are sent to the Death’s Domain because they are tired of your heroic deeds and the countless times you’ve cheated them of your life. Now you must escape their deathly grasp by navigating his dungeon, combat with their minions, and defeat Death to escape and return back to life, although they won’t make it so easy…

With this piece, I intend to raise the spirit of competition of the gaming community. People building communities to dissect and solve the game while others keep strategies for themselves to give themselves the best possible odds will create narratives like none other that will ultimately lead to the first person to ever complete the game. It will be a game that recognizes the best of the best despite the task seeming near impossible. Through their failure will eventually come success as long as they keep trying.

                  ​Jaymian Bustos, a digital artist born and raised in the Bay Area, works endlessly on his computer to produce the video games of his dreams. Growing up, he found a passion for video games from first-person shooters, fighting games, and roguelikes that allowed him to connect with others both online and offline. Using Unity and Aseprite as tools, Jaymian aims to connect others with the games created by himself and others and give them something to look forward to at the end of the day. Most of his works feature a pixel aesthetic with an intention to challenge the player with unforgiving and harsh game mechanics to truly give players a challenge.
