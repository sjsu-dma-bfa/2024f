            <p>
              DISCONNECT is an animated video and poster series about anxiety. Each illustration represents a different feeling or metaphor people would associate with anxiety, such as the familiar feeling of having “butterflies in your stomach” or feeling like you’re drowning. There are four posters: Butterflies, Burn, Drown, and Fear. Each illustration is animated into a looped short video. The posters offer a still image for anyone who would like a closer look at each illustration. I hope to resonate with people with these interpretations of anxiety as it is something everyone has had at least once in their life, whether it’s anxiety from taking an exam, anxiety for a job interview, work, family, etc. Anxiety is a universal experience that we all share. 

              <br />
              The illustrations were digitally drawn using Medibang Paint Pro and animated in After Effects.
              <br>
This series has allowed me to explore various concepts for each theme in my interpretations. My work focuses on 2D digital drawings and concept art, which gives me the freedom to experiment. It also serves as a means for me to express myself as someone who better conveys my feelings through drawings and writing. With DISCONNECT, I aim to present my conceptual ideas related to different aspects of anxiety.
