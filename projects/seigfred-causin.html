            <p>
              "Disruption" is a sculptural artwork by Seigfred Causin which addresses the accelerated pace of technology’s adoption in our daily lives. Throughout different works created through 3D modeling software, three different instances of the extremes of living with technology can be seen. The scenes display three different instances that Seigfred sees as some of the most common issues regarding technological modernisation. Causin’s artwork serves as a compelling reflection to our disposable electronic age, showcasing the side effects of those who engross themselves with electronics.


              <br />
              I’ve spent much of my life immersed in technology, and I’ve seen its numerous effects on people as well as have seen the benefits it provides. My affinity towards digital mediums of artworks has caused me to reflect on my relationship towards technology as well as its effects on my behavior. Despite the benefits that modern and mainstream technology offers, there still remain many downsides to the advancement and accessibility of modern technology to vulnerable individuals who fall victim to its integration within their daily lives. Each scene has been familiar to me, whether I’ve felt myself or others close to me succumb to the different depictions in some way.
