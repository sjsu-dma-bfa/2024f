            <p>
              "In the Stars" visually explores the complex emotions and experiences accompanying grief and healing. Inspired by a short story I wrote two years ago, this piece is part of a larger projectâ€”a detailed book that delves into the intricate layers of life during grief and the following healing process.
              <br/>
              Grief is a universal human experience, yet it is deeply personal and often isolating. Through "In the Stars," I aim to create a visual narrative that resonates with those who have experienced loss and those who seek to understand it.
              <br/>
              The piece is inspired by the structure of a storyboard, allowing viewers to engage with the narrative in a way that mirrors the storytelling process. Each frame serves as a snapshot of a moment, capturing the grieving process's raw emotions and subtle nuances.
              <br/>
              As I work towards completing the book, "In the Stars" visualizes the themes and ideas that will be explored in greater depth. This piece will spark conversations about grief, empathy, and the human experience, ultimately fostering a greater sense of connection and understanding among its viewers.
