            <p>
              Growing up I had always been interested in drawing more or less just to pass the time, but as I grew older I started to incorporate new interests into my drawings. One such new interest that has been prevalent in my drawings to this day is human anatomy. Starting with basic sketches of skeletons and eyeballs, I soon became enthralled with the entire build of the human body, along with all of its intricate details. I like to look beyond the average human form into the parts and pieces that all fit together to make that form.



              <br />
              I find the idea of mortality to be strangely comforting in that everything begins and everything ends, and it is through the human body that we get to experience everything in between. The body is versatile and complicated, composed of so many different parts and pieces that all fit together to create one whole cohesive being. Every body is different and special in its own way, and I find that illustrating human bodies helps to demonstrate that.

                  My parents were very supportive of me growing up and especially my mother would tell me to pursue something that I loved to do. Starting as nothing more than a hobby I would always find myself drawing to pass the time, and the more I would draw the more I would end up drawing eyeballs or skeletons. Human anatomy has also always been a fascination of mine, weather it be the incredible practical gory effects in old horror movies or Medical anatomy illustrations of the human body. I knew I did not have the passion to try and become a doctor so instead I am merging these two interests for this exhibit as to share the beauty of anatomy.
